## Overview
Boring Monday is a ArmA 3 Mission, initially created as a "seeder" type mission to be run to give players a scenario to hang around while waiting for other players to fill the server. As such, the mission was designed to feature a relaxing atmosphere with a wide variety of possibilities.
With a high degree of milsim in mind, this mission became a non-conventional counter insurgency type mission where players can roam around and explore the map as they like. The mission does not use any frameworks and has been made from scratch. To give players a rough idea on what to do, the mission features multiple pre-made objectives. High replay-ability is one of the core aspects of this mission. Therefore, a high degree of randomization is intended in addition to a ArmA 3 Zeus player who can further alter the experience.

*IMPORTANT:* The mission allows for up to 40 players, however, the more players are present, the easier the objectives become (especially with high value assets operated) and it becomes more boring than it already is. Executing all of the objectives will take some time. This mission caters for a specific type of gameplay and is best played as some kind of "mini MSO".

## Context
The mission focuses highly on infantry gameplay and features a infantry rifle platoon with a few attachments. Players are fighting in a counter insurgency theater in a middle eastern context. Due to the asymmetrical scenario, players do have the advantage regarding available assets and weaponary.
So far, a version is available featuring the German Armed Forces (earlier versions featured British Armed Forces). Other factions can easily be integrated into the mission but requires quite some adjustments to classnames and the overall mission.sqf.

## Objectives
Objectives are custom made and exist from start on. Thus, there is no spawning of enemies and no suddenly appearing structures. All missions are randomized to some degree and thus gameplay experience can vary greatly. Missions are merely a suggestion to the players. You are basically free to do whatever you feel like doing as long as you follow the briefing guidelines.

**Current objectives include:**
* Retrieving a flight recorder
* Clearing IED's around populated areas
* Finding and destroying weapon caches
* Terrorist Hunt
* Supporting Local National Army
* ...

## Some features:
* Custom gear that fits each role nicely
* Limited supplies available (no additional weaponry and other fluff)
* Briefing areas with custom made textures for immersive in-game briefings
* Custom ACRE channel names and preset radio channels for all units (no channel switching required upon spawning)
* A selection of air and ground vehicles
* Great flexibility for CO's to execute the objectives the way they want
* Enemy presence and behavior based on time of day
* ...
